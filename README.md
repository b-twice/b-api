# b-api
An API for me, b (brian). The API has grown organically and started as both an exploration into setting up  a .NET API and a need to expose data to various webb applications.

## Stack

* .NET Core 3
* .NET Entity Framework 3
* SQLite
* Swagger

## Modules

### Weather

Access DarkSky weather data.

### Finance

Expose views of financial records that are collected via an ETL from financial instutitions. Groups and summarizes data to see both high level and granular views of how much I am spending.


### Groceries

A key module supporting by my [groceries app](https://groceries.brianbrown.dev). Supports functionality for adding groceries, managing recipes and their ingredients, and pulling recipes into a weekly meal plan. A key part of tracking groceries is you are able to see the cost of recipes and meal plans, giving you a better picture of how much you are going to spend at the grocery store.

### Books

ks of books I've read or plan to read, going back to 2014. Useful for sharing what I read and remembering authors, so I can find other books from them. See [me app](https://me.brianbrown.dev/books).
