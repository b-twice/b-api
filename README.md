# b-api
API supporting various facets of my life. The API has grown organically, based on what I'm interested in or what I need to support one of my web apps.

## Modules

### Finance

The first module that was setup to answer the queston: How much a I spending? The Finance module supports managing bank transactions, tracking spending by categories, and tracking monthly budgets.


### Groceries

A key module supporting by my [groceries app](https://groceries.brianbrown.dev). Supports functionality for adding groceries, managing recipes and their ingredients, and pulling recipes into a weekly meal plan. A key part of tracking groceries is you are able to see the cost of recipes and meal plans, giving you a better picture of how much you are going to spend at the grocery store.

### Books

A small module, but a helpful one for a frequent reader. Keep tracks of books I've read or plan to read, going back to 2014. Useful for sharing what I read and remembering authors, so I can find other books from them. Check it out over at my [me app](https://me.brianbrown.dev/books).
